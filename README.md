# About
Choral-GTN is a deep learning system () trained to ____.

To find out more, check out the provided research paper:
  * **Doctoral Dissertation**: "Choral Music Generation: A Deep Hybrid Learning Approach" (DOI: [TBD](#)) 
  * **Conference Paper**: "TBD" (DOI: [TBD](#))
  * Also contained in the ["PaperAndPresentation"](https://github.com/danielathome19/Choral-GTN/tree/master/PaperAndPresentation) folder is the dissertation paper, conference paper (and supplement), and presentation of the research.
  * The dissertation defense can be watched at https://youtu.be/Rk9koF0V-2M.

# Usage
See:
  * TBD for a live demo of the full prediction system.
  * https://github.com/danielathome19/Choral-GTN/releases for a downloadable local demo of the prediction system.

For data used in my experiments:
  * All datasets can be found in 
  * My most recent pre-trained weights can be found in **Weights**.

**NOTE:** these folders should be placed in the **same** folder as "main.py". For folder existing conflicts, simply merge the directories.

In main.py, the "main" function acts as the controller for the model, where calls to train the model, create a prediction, and all other functions are called. One may also call these functions from an external script ("from main import XYZ", etc.).

To choose an operation or series of operations for the model to perform, simply edit the main function before running. Examples of all function calls can be seen commented out within main.
